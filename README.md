Question : Analysis of sub-categories contributing the highest share of overall losses from 2014 to 2017

-- Step 1
-- Aggregated profit at category and sub-category level
-- Exlcuded the one with positive profit from the result set

-- Step 2
-- Calculate running_loss and its % contribution in total loss

-- Step 3 
-- Keep subcategory which contribute to 95% in total loss

-- Step 4 
-- Analyse the yearly distribution for losses for top contributing sub-categories



Recommendation - 
- In the Furniture category, Tables are the biggest source of losses, contributing nearly 80% of the total loss.
- In 2017, Tables alone contributed around 38% of the overall loss, followed by 2015 (~16%) and 2014 (~14%). This indicates that the losses are spread across multiple years rather than being driven by a single bad year.
- Bookcases, on the other hand, contributed approximately 17% of the total loss. While this sub-category is also loss-making, its impact is significantly lower compared to Tables and more evenly distributed across the years.
  
Overall, losses are heavily concentrated in the Tables sub-category, making it the highest-priority area for further investigation, particularly across regions and discount levels.
